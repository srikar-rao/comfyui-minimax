# MiniMax-H3 video with its own soundtrack, ComfyUI on RunPod

Created by HearmemanAI. Something not working, or a question about a workflow? Ask in
help-and-support on [my Discord](https://discord.gg/ZVWVhT43GW). That is the only place I do
support, and it is also where new releases are announced.

MiniMax-H3 generates the picture and a 32 kHz stereo soundtrack in one pass. Dialogue, room tone,
footsteps and score come out of the same generation, so there is no separate TTS or lip-sync step.
Clips are 768p, 4 to 15 seconds, at 24 fps.

## Before you deploy

Set all of this on the template before you click Deploy, not after.

Click Edit Template and open the environment variables tab. Set `download_minimax_h3` to true. It
is off by default, and a pod without it boots a working but empty ComfyUI, so the workflows open
with blank loader dropdowns and look broken. The full list is in the next section.

Give the pod a network volume of at least 90 GB for the default quantized models. 100 GB is
comfortable and leaves room for your outputs. Full bf16 is much larger: use at least 180 GB, or
200 GB to leave comfortable output space.

If you want your own CivitAI LoRAs or checkpoints on the pod, set `civitai_token` and the ID
variables below. The steps are
[written up on my Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1359855405613715495/1536707221788950708),
and in
[this article](https://civitai.red/articles/12333/how-to-use-hearmemans-civitai-downloader-when-deploying-a-runpod-template).

Then deploy. The first boot takes 10 to 30 minutes. ComfyUI comes up while the models are still
downloading, so you can look around before it finishes. Later deploys on the same network volume
are much faster.

FYI: this template is built for CUDA 13.0 and above.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `download_minimax_h3` | false | Downloads the models for `minimaxH3ReferenceToVideo8_v10_cached.json` and installs that workflow only. Set it to true. |
| `download_viggle_animate` | false | Downloads the pruned BF16 Viggle-Animate model, original full DMD LoRA, frozen conditioning, video VAE and RIFE 4.26 interpolation weights (`models/frame_interpolation`); no workflows. Works independently of `download_minimax_h3`. The pinned Viggle node pack installs at boot regardless of this flag. |
| `minimax_quant` | int8 | Which build to download: int8, fp8, nvfp4, or bf16 (also accepted as false) for the full base. You can leave this alone. |
| `LLM_KEY` | empty | Optional fallback when the OpenRouter API Key box is blank. I2V/T2V use OpenRouter Simple: box value, then `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, then `LLM_KEY`. R2V keeps its Reference Pack key box. |
| `civitai_token` | empty | Your CivitAI API token |
| `CIVITAI_LORAS` | empty | Comma-separated CivitAI version IDs. They go to `models/loras`. |
| `CIVITAI_CHECKPOINTS` | empty | Comma-separated CivitAI version IDs. They go to `models/checkpoints`. |
| `HF_TOKEN` | empty | Optional. Raises your Hugging Face rate limit, which makes a first boot less likely to stall. |

About `minimax_quant`: the default int8 runs natively on every GPU RunPod rents and the
reference-to-video workflow is already set up for it. fp8 is native on 4090, L40, H100, H200 and
RTX 50xx cards and emulated on anything older, which makes it slower there. nvfp4 downloads the
same Ref2VA file as fp8 and only accelerates on RTX 50xx. Set `minimax_quant` to `bf16` (or the
existing `false` value) to download `minimax_h3_ref2va_bf16.safetensors` instead of the int8
build. The text encoder, video VAE, audio VAE, preview VAE and the Ref2V 8-step Turbo LoRA stay
the same. FL2VA, the other Turbo LoRAs, HyperFlow and the latent upscaler are not downloaded.
Only the profile you ask for is downloaded and the workflow is pointed at that file for you.

The template still installs the
[MiniMax H3 Latent Upscaler nodes](https://github.com/LBH-123-AI/Comfyui_Minimax_h3_latent_Upscaler),
but it does not download the upscaler weight or install the other MiniMax workflows.

## Once it is up

Click Connect, then open port 8188 for ComfyUI or port 8888 for JupyterLab. The boot log is at
`/workspace/comfyui.log`.

Open the Workflows tab in ComfyUI. Every workflow carries notes in the graph telling you what it
does and which settings matter, which is a better place to read than this page. The pod also writes
three notes into the top of that same list on first boot: Welcome, Adding Models, and
Troubleshooting. The Welcome note covers writing a prompt H3 responds to, which is most of the
difference between MiniMax's demo reels and a clip that comes out near-silent.
